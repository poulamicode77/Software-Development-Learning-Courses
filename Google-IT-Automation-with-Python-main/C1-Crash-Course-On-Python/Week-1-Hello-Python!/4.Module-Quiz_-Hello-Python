Question 1
Why is it important to be very precise about what a computer program is supposed to do?
Ans--> Computers do exactly what they are told.

2.
Question 2
Which of the following are true about programming languages? Select all that apply.
Ans--> Similar to human language, programming languages use syntax and semantics.
Programming languages are used to write computer programs and scripts.
Some common programming languages include Python, Java, C, C++, C#, and R.

3.
Question 3
What are some tasks that might be a good fit for full automation? Select all that apply.
Ans--> Detecting and removing duplicate data
Updating specific files on multiple computers

4.
Question 4
What is the difference between syntax and semantics in a programming language?
Ans--> Syntax is a set of rules for how statements are constructed. Semantics refers to the intended meaning or effect of statements. 

5.
Question 5
What is the program that reads and executes Python code by translating it to computer instructions called?
Ans--> Interpreter

6.
Question 6
Write a Python script that outputs "Automating with Python is fun!" to the screen. Remember that syntax precision is important in programming languages.
A missing capital letter, spelling error, or punctuation mark can produce errors.
Ans--> print("Automating with Python is fun!")

Question 7
What should be the output of the expression below? 
print(2+2/((2+2)+(2**2)))
Ans--> 2.25

Question 8
Assuming there are 60 minutes in an hour, write a program that calculates the number of minutes in a 24 hour day.
Print the result on the screen. Note: Your result should be in the format of just a number, not a sentence.
Ans--> # Enter code here:
print(24*60)
# Should print 1440

Question 9
In a passcode where each digit of the passcode is independent of the other digits and each digit can be any numeral from 0 through 9, the total number of combinations is the number of possibilities for each digit raised to the power of the length of the passcode. So, for a 1-numeral passcode, there would be 10 possibilities; one for every numeral from 0 to 9.  For a 2-numeral passcode, each numeral is independent of the other, so there would be 10 times 10 possibilities. 
Using this information, use Python to calculate and print the number of possible passwords that can be formed with 3 numerals. 
Note: Your result should be in the number format, not a sentence.
Ans--> # Should print 1000
print(10**3)

Question 10
Consider this scenario about using Python to make calculations:
On a college campus, there are 30 computers in each of the 20 computer labs that are spread across campus.  The computers have a life cycle where they are replaced every five  years. One-fifth of the computers are replaced each year. 
Fill in the blank to calculate the number of computers that are replaced each year by dividing the total computers by the replacement cycle. Note: Your result should be a number. 
Ans--> total_computers = 30*20
replacement_cycle = 5
computers_per_year = total_computers/replacement_cycle
print(computers_per_year) # Should print 120.0
