Question 1
When a user reports that an "application doesn't work," what is an appropriate follow-up question to gather more information about the problem?

Ans--> What should happen when you open the app?

2.
Question 2

Ans--> The observer effect.

Question 3
The compare_strings function is supposed to compare just the alphanumeric content of two strings, ignoring upper vs lower case and punctuation. 
But something is not working. Fill in the code to try to find the problems, then fix the problems. Your goal is to search for the character “-” but - is typically reserved for ranges. 
Find a work-around that enables you to compare the two strings.

Ans--> import re
def compare_strings(string1, string2):
 #Convert both strings to lowercase
 #and remove leading and trailing blanks
 string1 = string1.lower().strip()
 string2 = string2.lower().strip()

 #Ignore punctuation
 punctuation = r"[^\w\s]" # re.error: bad character range :-' at position 6
 string1 = re.sub(punctuation, r"", string1)
 string2 = re.sub(punctuation, r"", string2)

 #DEBUG CODE GOES HERE
 return string1 == string2
print(compare_strings("Have a Great Day!", "Have a great day?")) # True
print(compare_strings("It's raining again.", "its raining, again")) # True
print(compare_strings("Learn to count: 1, 2, 3.", "Learn to count: one, two, three.")) # False
print(compare_strings("They found some body.", "They found somebody.")) # False

Question 4
How do we verify if a problem is still persisting or not?

Ans--> Attempt to trigger the problem again by following the steps of our reproduction case

Question 5
The datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times, and contains many types, objects, and methods. 
You've seen some of them used in the dow function, which returns the day of the week for a specific date. 
We'll use them again in the next_date function, which takes the date_string parameter in the format of "year-month-day", and uses the add_year function to calculate the next year that 
this date will occur (it's 4 years later for the 29th of February during Leap Year, and 1 year later for all other dates). 
Then it returns the value in the same format as it receives the date: "year-month-day".
Can you find the error in the code? Is it in the next_date function or the add_year function? How can you determine if the add_year function returns what it's supposed to?
Add debug lines as necessary to find the problems, then fix the code to work as indicated above.   

Ans--> import datetime
from datetime import date

def add_year(date_obj):
  try:
    new_date_obj = date_obj.replace(year = date_obj.year + 1)
  except ValueError:
    # This gets executed when the above method fails, 
    # which means that we're making a Leap Year calculation
    new_date_obj = date_obj.replace(year = date_obj.year + 4)
  return new_date_obj

def next_date(date_string):
  # Convert the argument from string to date object
  date_obj = datetime.datetime.strptime(date_string, r"%Y-%m-%d")
  next_date_obj = add_year(date_obj)

  # Convert the datetime object to string, 
  # in the format of "yyyy-mm-dd"
  next_date_string = next_date_obj.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
  return next_date_string

today = date.today()  # Get today's date
print(next_date(str(today))) 
# Should return a year from today, unless today is Leap Day

print(next_date("2021-01-01")) # Should return 2022-01-01
print(next_date("2020-02-29")) # Should return 2024-02-29
